WarPath is a gui-based program to interactively build lists for point-based tabletop wargames. It was developed with
Games Workshop's Warhammer and Warhammer 40000 in mind, but it does not enforce rules or implement specific details
related to those. Lists of available units, their point costs, and their options can be developed using the WarPathPlanner
companion program (preferred method), or by hand following the two example lists provided in the data/ folder.

A video tutorial is available on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Fm1nGXQ-Y4&list=UULOeO-F5PrHjABjrIcv-Vgg.

This software relies on the Qt libraries and it is released as opensource. See the file COPYING.txt for more details.
